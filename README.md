## Deep Reinforcement Learning Global Routing
This project is based on our published paper "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Global Routing" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08809.pdf).
It uses deep Q-learning (DQN) to solve the challenging global routing problem by leveraging the "conjoint optimization" mechanism  of DQN. Superior performance compared to A* search (which is a typical baseline routing algorithm) in certain types of problems.


#### 1. Environment Setup:
To setup your environment (which contains depencies with the correct version), use the conda environment specified in environment.yml by simply doing the following with a recent version of conda in Linux/Bash (https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html), in the repository path:
```
conda env create
source activate GlobalRoutingProblemGenerator
```
To deactivate the virtual environment:
'''
conda deactivate
'''
